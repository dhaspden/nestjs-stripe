## About

`nestjs-stripe` implements a module, `StripeModule`, which when imported into
your nestjs project provides a Stripe client to any class that injects it. This
lets Stripe be worked into your dependency injection workflow without having to
do any extra work outside of the initial setup.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save nestjs-stripe
```

## Getting Started

The simplest way to use `nestjs-stripe` is to use `StripeModule.forRoot`

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs-common';
import { StripeModule } from 'nestjs-stripe';

@Module({
  imports: [
    StripeModule.forRoot({
      apiKey: 'my_secret_key',
      apiVersion: '2020-08-27',
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

You can then inject the Stripe client into any of your injectables by using a
custom decorator

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { InjectStripe } from 'nestjs-stripe';
import Stripe from 'stripe';

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  public constructor(@InjectStripe() private readonly stripeClient: Stripe) {}
}
```

Asynchronous setup is also supported

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs-common';
import { StripeModule } from 'nestjs-stripe';

@Module({
  imports: [
    StripeModule.forRootAsync({
      inject: [ConfigService],
      useFactory: (configService: ConfigService) => ({
        apiKey: configService.get('stripe_key'),
        apiVersion: '2020-03-02',
      }),
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Read up on the `stripe-node` caveats
[here](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node#usage-with-typescript). Due to the
way `stripe-node` works you can only use the latest version of the Stripe API
that was published at the time the module version was published. If you wish to
use an older version of the Stripe API, follow the steps in the above link.
Because of this, the `apiVersion` field is now required along with the `apiKey`
field.

## Example

In order to run the example run the following commands in your terminal. The
expected output of the example is to show that the Stripe client was
successfully injected into the `AppService`.

```bash
cd example
yarn install
yarn start
```
